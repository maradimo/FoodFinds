# FoodFinds

## Project concept

FoodFinds is an app meant to be used by college students looking to give away their unused meal swipes for the week, get information about leftovers from club events, or find free food on campus either by picking it up directly from other people or from pantries.

FoodFinds seeks to address issues of food waste in a feel-good way, eliminating discomfort users may feel from revealing to their peers that they need an extra meal swipe or would be willing to take food items their peers had given away. FoodFinds is trying to reduce food waste by making its users aware of how much food they are potentially throwing away and making them feel good about having exchanged that food instead of throwing it away.

## Project Ambition
We aim to provide a common solution for all Columbia students regardless of background and goals to share and get food that would otherwise be wasted on campus. We are aiming to cover all possible sources of food waste: club events food, unused meal swipes, personal items in a way that is convenient, friendly, social and inclusive. Moreover, encouraging safe exchanges with respect to allergies and other concerns, maintaining pantries and incentivizing our users to participate in the exchanges are challenges that our team is committed to overcoming for the greater aim of reducing food waste at Columbia.
